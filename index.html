        <p class="lead mb-4"> Born and raised by immigrant parents, I know what hard work looks like and how to do it. Started my life living in a garage with my parents in Montebello. as time passed by we moved to apartments in Huntington Park and now we are all living in a home. Not only does this show the hard work my parents went through but it also shows the lessons my parents have taught me throughout my life. Just as being persistent, having goals, and never giving up no matter the circumstances.   <br><br>

        Throughout my childhood I was faced with many situations where I wanted to give up and dissapear. Instances such as being bullied, being broke, and even discrimination. These are all things a child should never go through but have made me stronger and the person I am today. These experiences allowed me to become a better person than those who would bully or discriminate me. It also enlightened me that anyone who bullied me would do it because they were either having a hard time at home or where just as unhappy as me with life. Little did I know that getting bullied would show me a side of me that I would one day enjoy. While I was in High School I was given the advice that as long as you can laugh at yourself nothing will hurt you. Once I figured that out I was unstoppable. Instead of running away from the bullys I joined them along with making fun of myself. as time flew by those jokes I did aout myself turned into a passion I enjoy to this day. The passion being I love making people laugh and smile. It is my passion because it makes people forget about their problems and even hardships for a while. It makes everyone take a breather even if they dont feel it. I enjoy spreading positive energy and making people happy because that's how I was shaped to be throughout my life.<br><br>

        I know deeply that childhood Juan would be proud of the person he is today. Not only have I overcame dark moments in my life but I have also been through many proud moments as well. Such as beig accepted into UCR, getting my GPA back to a good number, helped my community, annd making people smile everyday. Currently, as of the time I am writing this I am working at Home Depot. Not only does it satisfy me when I let a customer know where to find the things he or she or they are looking but it feels all natural to me. If I know I can get someone to smile or make their day a little better I will do it.In the end we are all the same race ( Human Race) we should treat each other like brothers and sisters since we alllive in the same planet.
